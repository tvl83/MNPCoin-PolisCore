What is Polis?
----------------

MonetaryUnit is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. MonetaryUnit uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. MonetaryUnit Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of
the MonetaryUnit Core software, see http://www.monetaryunit.org/.
